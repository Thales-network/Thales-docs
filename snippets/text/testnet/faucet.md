Tokens on Thalesbase, named DEV, will be issued on demand. Currently, there are two ways you can get access to this token: through a Discord bot, or manually.

### Discord - Mission Control

To request tokens automatically, we've created a Discord bot (named Mission Control :sunglasses:) that will automatically send a maximum of 10 DEV tokens every 24 hours (per Discord user) when you enter your address. You can check it out on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/PfpUATX). For more information, please visit [this site](/getting-started/testnet/faucet/).
 
Under the category "Miscellaneous", you will find our AlphaNet bot channel. Enter the following message, replacing `<enter-address-here->` with your H160 address:
 
```
!faucet send <enter-address-here->
```

### Manual Procedure

For token requests of more than the limited account allowed by our Discord bot, contact a moderator directly via our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/PfpUATX). We are happy to provide the tokens needed to test your applications.
