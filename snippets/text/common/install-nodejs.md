We need to install Node.js (we'll use v15.x) and the npm package manager. You can download directly from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or in your terminal:

--8<-- 'code/common/install-nodejs-commands.md'

We can verify that everything is installed correctly by querying the version for each package:

```
node -v
```

```
npm -v
```
