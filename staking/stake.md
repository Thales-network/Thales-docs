# How to Stake your Tokens

![Staking Thales Banner](/images/staking/staking-stake-banner.png)

## Introduction

Collators (block producers) with the highest stake in the network join the active pool of collators, from which they are selected to offer a block to the Relay Chain.

Token holders can add to the collators' stake using their tokens, a process called nomination (also referred to as staking). When they do so, they are vouching for that specific collator, and their nomination is a signal of trust.

When a collator does not behave appropriately, its stake in the network is slashed, affecting the tokens nominated by users as well (feature currently not available in Thalesbase Alpha). If collators act accordingly, they'll receive block rewards as part of the inflationary model. They can share these as staking rewards with their nominators.

With the release of [Thalesbase Alpha v6](https://github.com/Thales-network/thales/releases/tag/v0.6.0), users of the network can now stake their tokens to nominate collators. This guide outlines all the steps to do so.

## General Definitions

--8<-- 'text/staking/staking-definitions.md'

Currently, for Thalesbase Alpha:

|             Variable             |     |                         Value                         |
| :------------------------------: | :-: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
|     Minimum nomination stake     |     |     {{ networks.thalesbase.staking.min_nom_stake }}     |
|        Minimum nomination        |     |     {{ networks.thalesbase.staking.min_nom_amount}}     | | Maximum nominators per collators |     |     {{ networks.thalesbase.staking.max_nom_per_col }}   |
| Maximum collators per nominator  |     |     {{ networks.thalesbase.staking.max_col_per_nom }}   |
|              Round               |     | {{ networks.thalesbase.staking.round_blocks }} blocks ({{ networks.thalesbase.staking.round_hours }} hours) |
|          Bond duration           |     |     {{ networks.thalesbase.staking.bond_lock }} rounds  |

## Extrinsics Definitions

There are many extrinsics related to the staking pallet, so all of them are not covered in this guide. However, this list defines all of the extrinsics associated with the nomination process:

!!! note
    Extrinsics might change in the future as the staking pallet is updated.

 - **nominate** — two inputs: address of collator to nominate and amount. Extrinsic to nominate a collator. The amount must be at least {{ networks.thalesbase.staking.min_nom_amount }} tokens
 - **leaveNominators** — no inputs. Extrinsic to leave the set of nominators. Consequently, all ongoing nominations will be revoked
 - **nominatorBondLess** — two inputs: address of a nominated collator and amount. Extrinsic to reduce the amount of staked tokens for an already nominated collator. The amount must not decrease your overall total staked below {{ networks.thalesbase.staking.min_nom_stake }} tokens
 - **nominatorBondMore** — two inputs: address of a nominated collator and amount. Extrinsic to increase the amount of staked tokens for an already nominated collator
 - **revokeNomination** — one input: address of a nominated collator. Extrinsic to remove an existing nomination

## Retrieving the List of Collators

Before starting to stake tokens, it is important to retrieve the list of collators available in the network. To do so, navigate to "Chain state" under the "Developer" tab.


Here, provide the following information:

 1. Choose the pallet to interact with. In this case, it is the `parachainStaking` pallet
 2. Choose the state to query. In this case, it is the `selectedCandidates` or `candidatePool` state
 3. Send the state query by clicking on the "+" button

Each extrinsic provides a different response:

 - **selectedCandidates** — returns the current active set of collators, that is, the top {{ networks.thalesbase.staking.max_collators }} collators by total tokens staked (including nominations)
 - **candidatePool** — returns the current list of all the collators, including those that are not in the active set


## How to Nominate a Collator

This section goes over the process of nominating collators. The tutorial will use the following collators as reference:

|  Variable  |     |                      Address                       |
| :--------: | :-: | :------------------------------------------------: |
| Collator 1 |     | {{ networks.thalesbase.staking.collators.address1 }} |
| Collator 2 |     | {{ networks.thalesbase.staking.collators.address2 }} |

To access staking features, you need to use the PolkadotJS Apps interface. To do so, you need to import/create an Ethereum-style account first (H160 address), which you can do by following [this guide](/integrations/wallets/polkadotjs/#creating-or-importing-an-h160-account).

For this example, an account was imported and named with a super original name: Alice.

Currently, everything related to staking needs to be accessed via the "Extrinsics" menu, under the "Developer" tab:


To nominate a collator, provide the following information:

 1. Select the account from which you want to stake your tokens
 2. Choose the pallet you want to interact with. In this case, it is the `parachainStaking` pallet
 3. Choose the extrinsic method to use for the transaction. This will determine the fields that need to fill in the following steps. In this case, it is the `nominate` extrinsic
 4. Set the collator's address you want to nominate. In this case, it is set to `{{ networks.thalesbase.staking.collators.address1 }}`
 5. Set the number of tokens you want to stake
 6. Click the "Submit Transaction" button and sign the transaction


Once the transaction is confirmed, you can head back to the "Accounts" tab to verify that you have a reserved balance (equal to the number of tokens staked).

To verify a nomination, you can navigate to "Chain state" under the "Developer" tab.


Here, provide the following information:

 1. Choose the pallet you want to interact with. In this case, it is the `parachainStaking` pallet
 2. Choose the state to query. In this case, it is the `nominators` state
 3. Make sure to disable the "include option" slider
 4. Send the state query by clicking on the "+" button


In the response, you should see your account (in this case, Alice's account) with a list of the nominations. Each nomination contains the target address of the collator and the amount.

You can follow the same steps as described to nominate other collators in the network. For example, Alice nominated `{{ networks.thalesbase.staking.collators.address2 }}` as well.

## How to Stop Nominations

If you are already a nominator, you have two options to stop your nominations: using the `revokeNomination` extrinsic to unstake your tokens from a specific collator, or using the `leaveNominators` extrinsic to revoke all ongoing nominations.

This example is a continuation of the previous section, and assumes that you have at least two active nominations.

You can remove your nomination from a specific collator by navigating to the "Extrinsics" menu under the "Developer" tab. Here, provide the following information:

 1. Select the account from which you want to remove your nomination
 2. Choose the pallet you want to interact with. In this case, it is the `parachainStaking` pallet
 3. Choose the extrinsic method to use for the transaction. This will determine the fields that need to fill in the following steps. In this case, it is the `revokeNomination` extrinsic
 4. Set the collator's address you want to remove your nomination from. In this case, it is set to `{{ networks.thalesbase.staking.collators.address2 }}`
 5. Click the "Submit Transaction" button and sign the transaction


Once the transaction is confirmed, you can verify that your nomination was removed in the "Chain state" option under the "Developer" tab.

Here, provide the following information:

 1. Choose the pallet you want to interact with. In this case, it is the `parachainStaking` pallet
 2. Choose the state to query. In this case, it is the `nominatorState` state
 3. Make sure to disable the "include options" slider
 4. Send the state query by clicking on the "+" button


In the response, you should see your account (in this case, Alice's account) with a list of the nominations. Each nomination contains the target address of the collator, and the amount.

As mentioned before, you can also remove all ongoing nominations with the `leaveNominators` extrinsic (in step 3 of the "Extrinsics" instructions). This extrinsic requires no input:


Once the transaction is confirmed, your account should not be listed in the `nominatorState` state when queried, and you should have no reserved balance (related to staking).

## Staking Rewards

As collators receive rewards from block production, nominators get rewards as well. A brief overview on how the rewards are calculated can be found in [this page](/staking/overview/#reward-distribution).

In summary, nominators will earn rewards based on their stake of the total nominations for the collator being rewarded (including the collator's stake as well).

From the previous example, Alice was rewarded with `0.0044` tokens after two payout rounds:
