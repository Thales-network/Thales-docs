# Welcome to Thales

![Main Page Banner](/images/main-banner.png)

This site provides documentation for Thales, a smart contract parachain on the Polkadot network that is fully Ethereum Compatible.  Here, you'll find both high-level and technical information for developers, collators, end-users, and other Thales network participants.

This site will grow and be refined over time as Thales is developed.  We welcome you to join the Thales community and contribute to this site and to the project.

## What is Thales? 

Thales is a developer-oriented blockchain that strives to provide compatibility with the existing Ethereum developer toolchain and network.  It does this by providing a full EVM implementation, a Web3-compatible API, and bridges that connect Thales to existing Ethereum networks.  This allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Thales with minimal changes.

Thales will also be a parachain on the Polkadot network. That means it will get shared security from the Polkadot relay chain and will be able to integrate with other chains that are connected to Polkadot (once that functionality is available on Polkadot).
