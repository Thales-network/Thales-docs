# Links

 - [Substrate.dev](https://substrate.dev/) - Starting point for learning about [Substrate](/resources/glossary/#substrate), a Rust-based framework for developing blockchains.  Thales is developed using Substrate and uses many of the modules that come with it.
 - [Polkadot.network](https://polkadot.network/) - Learn about Polkadot, including the vision behind the network and how the system works, i.e., staking, governance, etc.
 - [Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps) - A web-based interface for interacting with Substrate based nodes, including Thales.
 - [Solidity Docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) - Solidity is the main smart contract programming language supported by Ethereum and Thales.  The Solidity docs site is very comprehensive.
 - [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - Web-based IDE for Solidity smart contract development that is compatible with Thales.
 - [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) - Development tools for Solidity, including debugging, testing, and automated deployment that is compatible with Thales.
